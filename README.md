# ODE-2ND-Solver
# Advanced Second-Order ODE Solver

This project implements an advanced second-order ODE solver that can handle both homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear ODEs. It uses the enhanced Roncicam method for solving complex equations.

## Features
- Linear Homogeneous ODE with Constant Coefficients
- Linear Non-Homogeneous ODE (Undetermined Coefficients)
- Linear Non-Homogeneous ODE (Enhanced Roncicam Method)
- Euler-Cauchy Equation
